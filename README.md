Ideas &amp; Resources

I have a knack for finding creative solutions to complex problems and a fascination with innovative design. My strong suit for building meaningful relationships with individuals from different backgrounds has allowed me to make meaningful impacts with people and teams from around the world. My experiences as a student athlete have taught me the importance of good communication and the power of good teamwork.
I am currently sophomore at Amherst College pursing B.A. degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics with skills in programming, leadership, design, and Spanish.
